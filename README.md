# The What-If Machine: Valonia ventricosa

An interactive timeline-based website exploring the potential future of *Valonia ventricosa* engineering and research.

## About

*Valonia ventricosa*, also known as "bubble algae" or "sailor's eyeballs," is one of the largest known single-celled organisms, reaching up to 5cm in diameter. Despite its remarkable size and unique biological properties, this species has been relatively under-explored scientifically.

This project presents a Wikipedia-style page that uses an interactive timeline to explore different future scenarios:
- **Present Day**: Current knowledge and research
- **6 Months**: Genomic sequencing breakthroughs
- **1 Year**: Expanding research capabilities
- **10 Years**: Full synthetic biology applications

## Features

- 📚 Wikipedia-inspired design and layout
- ⏱️ Interactive timeline navigation (inspired by the Wayback Machine)
- 📊 Size comparison visualizations
- 🧬 Genomic sequence information
- 🔬 Historical research methodology documentation
- 📱 Fully responsive design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- No external dependencies
